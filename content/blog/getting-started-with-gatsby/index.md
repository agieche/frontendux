I wanted to start a blog about frontend related topics a long time ago. Due to the inspiration
at Google I/O 19, I started to setup my blog this evening. Since I read a lot of good feedback about it, I 
wanted to build this blog a static site generator called [gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

I went for it, since it is

- easy to setup
- easy to reason about, since it supports markdown as content input
- documented very well
- praised on twitter and on other blogs.

I found several great introductions on how to setup a gatsby blog, e.g. [here](https://daveceddia.com/start-blog-gatsby-netlify/).

## How to run gatsby locally

1. Install CLI
```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

2. Create a new site
```shell
gatsby new my_site_name
```

3. Start developing
```shell
cd my_site_name
gatsby develop
```
