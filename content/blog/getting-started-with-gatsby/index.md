description: Follow my short journey on starting a development blog with gatsby.
---

I wanted to start a blog about frontend related topics for a long time now. Due to the inspiration
at [Google I/O 19](https://events.google.com/io/), I started to setup my blog this evening. Since I read a lot of good feedback about it, I 
wanted to build this blog with a static site generator called [gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). I only have experience with rails and wordpress, when it comes serving a blog - so this is a complete new stack for me. YAY! ðŸ˜» Let's dive in.

## Gatsby FTW

I decided to give **gatsby** a spin, since it is

- easy to setup
- easy to reason about, since it supports markdown as content input
- documented very well
- praised among developers for its ease and joy of use.

I found several great introductions on how to [setup a gatsby blog](https://daveceddia.com/start-blog-gatsby-netlify/) in general, but since developers also need some plugins for code highlighting, I decided to write my own setup article.

-----------------

## How to run gatsby locally

**Prerequisites**
- Text Editor
- Web Browser
- Node + NPM or Yarn

**Install CLI**
```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

**Create a new site from the gatsby blog template**
```shell
gatsby new my-frontend-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

or alternatively create a blank new site

```shell
gatsby new my_site_name
```

**Start developing**

```shell
cd my-frontend-blog
gatsby develop
```

**Open browser to access dev server**

```
http://localhost:8000/
```

**Simulate a build for production**

Since gatsby is a static site generator, all of your code and content is translated into static html, js and css, which can be served even on simple hosting providers. If you want to trigger a build for production, you run:

```shell
gatsby build
````
After the build is finished, the `./public` directory should be populated with your updated blog site including all html, images, js and css.

-----------------

## Write your content with Markdown

Gatsby is very flexible when it comes to data sources. One easy way to insert data into your blog is by writing markdown files. Your first article (when using the blog starter pack) is editable under `./content/hello-world`. You can add new directories (with an index.md) to the `content`-directory  to add new articles. Gatsby will figure out, that there is a new article and will display it on the homepage article listing.

If you\'re not familiar with Markdown yet, have a look at the [Markdown GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

```markdown
// content/blog/hello_world.md
---
title: Hello world
date: "2019-05-22T22:12:03.284Z"

feedback about it, I wanted to build this blog with a static
site generator called [gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
I only have experience with rails and wordpress, when it comes
serving a blog, this is a complete new stack for me. YAY! Let/'s dive in.

```

-----------------


## Adjust styling

The default layout, that is provided from the starter teomplate is clean, but you definitely want to give it a little twist to make your blog stand our a little. To add a globally available style, you may add a layout.css file.


```css
/* src/components/layout.css */

html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

*, ::before, ::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

Then, include the layout.css within your layout component.

```js{numberLines: true}
// src/components/layout.js
import React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"
// highlight-next-line
import "./layout.css"

class Layout extends React.Component {
    // snipped for brevity
}
```

```js
// src/components/layout.js
import React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"
// highlight-next-line
import "./layout.css"

class Layout extends React.Component {
    // snipped for brevity
}
```



Finished! Now, your global styling should be included by your layout component. Since the layout component is present on every route, the style is loaded everywhere. Lets proceed to plugins.

-----------------

## Code Highlighting with Gatsby Plugins
To make code examples easier to grasp, syntax highlighting is a nice addition when using a `<pre>`.

Install gatsby-remark-prismjs

```shell
npm install --save gatsby-transformer-remark gatsby-remark-prismjs prismjs
```

Adjust your gatsby-config.js
```js
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        {
          resolve: `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
          options: {
            // Class prefix for <pre> tags containing syntax highlighting;
            // defaults to 'language-' (eg <pre class="language-js">).
            // If your site loads Prism into the browser at runtime,
            // (eg for use with libraries like react-live),
            // you may use this to prevent Prism from re-processing syntax.
            // This is an uncommon use-case though;
            // If you're unsure, it's best to use the default value.
            classPrefix: "language-",
            // This is used to allow setting a language for inline code
            // (i.e. single backticks) by creating a separator.
            // This separator is a string and will do no white-space
            // stripping.
            // A suggested value for English speakers is the non-ascii
            // character 'â€º'.
            inlineCodeMarker: null,
            // This lets you set up language aliases.  For example,
            // setting this to '{ sh: "bash" }' will let you use
            // the language "sh" which will highlight using the
            // bash highlighter.
            aliases: {},
            // This toggles the display of line numbers globally alongside the code.
            // To use it, add the following line in src/layouts/index.js
            // right after importing the prism color scheme:
            //  `require("prismjs/plugins/line-numbers/prism-line-numbers.css");`
            // Defaults to false.
            // If you wish to only show line numbers on certain code blocks,
            // leave false and use the {numberLines: true} syntax below
            showLineNumbers: false,
            // If setting this to true, the parser won't handle and highlight inline
            // code used in markdown i.e. single backtick code like `this`.
            noInlineHighlight: false,
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
]
```

Pick a theme (available [here](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/tree/master/themes))
```js{numberLines: true}
// gatsby-browser.js
require("prismjs/themes/prism-tomorrow.css");
```

Insert a code example into your article:
```markdown
// content/blog/hello_world.md

```js
console.log('hello world');
```                                                                     `

```

and it will be displayed as:

```js
console.log('hello world');
```

-----------------

## Enable line numbers and line-highlighting

To make your code examples even better to understand, you can add support for **line numbers** and highlighting of specific line(s). Here's how you do it. First, add the corresponding styling in your browser file.

```js
//gatsby-browser.js
require("prismjs/plugins/line-numbers/prism-line-numbers.css")
```

Now you need to add some more custom styles to make prism styles work with gatsby:

```css
/*layout.css*/

/* code highlighting */
.gatsby-highlight-code-line {
  background-color: #4d4d4d; /* Adjust for your prismjs theme color */
  display: block;
  margin-right: -1em;
  margin-left: -1em;
  padding-right: 1em;
  padding-left: 0.75em;
  border-left: 0.25em solid #f99;
}

/* Make the highlightline start at the beginning of the line,
when line numbers are displayed */
.line-numbers .gatsby-highlight-code-line {
  margin-left: -3.8em;
  padding-left: 3.55em;
}

/**
 * Add back the container background-color, border-radius, padding, margin
 * and overflow that we removed from <pre>.
 */
 .gatsby-highlight {
  background-color: #2d2d2d; /* Use your prismjs theme color */
  border-radius: 0.3em;
  margin: 0;
  margin-bottom: 2.5rem;
  padding: 1em;
  overflow: auto;
}

/**
 * Remove the default PrismJS theme background-color, border-radius, margin,
 * padding and overflow.
 * 1. Make the element just wide enough to fit its content.
 * 2. Always fill the visible space in .gatsby-highlight.
 * 3. Adjust the position of the line numbers
 */
.gatsby-highlight pre[class*="language-"] {
  background-color: transparent;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: initial;
  float: left; /* 1 */
  min-width: 100%; /* 2 */
}


/**
 * If you only want to use line numbering
 */
.gatsby-highlight pre[class*="language-"].line-numbers {
  padding: 0;
  padding-left: 2.8em;
  overflow: initial;
}
```

Ok, lets try it out:

```markdown


`````js{numberLines: true}
console.log('line1');
console.log('line2');
console.log('line3');
```                                                                                      `

```

is now displayed as:

```js{numberLines: true}
console.log('line1');
console.log('line2');
console.log('line3');
```

Isn't this a nice touch for your new devblog? ðŸŽ‰ So that\'s it about code highlighting.

## Add google analytics to your blog

If you want to have insights on, how often your blog is visited and by whom, it's very easy to integrate google analytics tracking with gatsby. 

```shell
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-google-analytics
# or
yarn add gatsby-plugin-google-analytics
```

After installing, just add this bit of code to your config file:
```js

// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-google-analytics`,
      options: {
        trackingId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID",
        // Defines where to place the tracking script - `true` in the head and `false` in the body
        head: false,
        // Setting this parameter is optional
        anonymize: true,
        // Setting this parameter is also optional
        respectDNT: true,
        // Avoids sending pageview hits from custom paths
        exclude: ["/preview/**", "/do-not-track/me/too/"],
        // Enables Google Optimize using your container Id
        optimizeId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_OPTIMIZE_TRACKING_ID",
        // Enables Google Optimize Experiment ID
        experimentId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_EXPERIMENT_ID",
        // Set Variation ID. 0 for original 1,2,3....
        variationId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_OPTIMIZE_VARIATION_ID",
        // Any additional create only fields (optional)
        sampleRate: 5,
        siteSpeedSampleRate: 10,
        cookieDomain: "example.com",
      },
    },
  ],
}

```

For more info about the plugin, visit the [plugin page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-google-analytics/).

-----------------

## Add a comment form below your article

One easy way to enable comments for your content is **disqus**.  More info [here](https://disqus.com/).

Install the disqus plugin for gatsby:

```shell
npm install -S gatsby-plugin-disqus
# or
yarn add gatsby-plugin-disqus
```

Adjust your config file and insert your disqus short name there. In case, you don't have a disqus account, register [here](https://disqus.com/).

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-disqus`,
      options: {
        shortname: `your-disqus-shortname`
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

Now, you can add the Disqus Component to your article template.

```js
// src/templates/blog-post
import Disqus from 'gatsby-plugin-disqus'

class BlogPostTemplate extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const post = this.props.data.markdownRemark

    return (
      <Layout>
        /* post snipped for brevity */
        <Disqus 
          identifier={post.id}
          title={post.frontmatter.title}
        />
      </Layout>
    )
  }
}

```

Now, there should be a comment form below your post. ðŸŽ‰
